Hi, I’m Tyler. I create new things and utilize automation and Outside-The-Box thinking to help solve your problems.
I enjoy developing rich multimedia web applications and data driven visualizations. In my work I research and utilize the latest technology and automation to maximize my productivity and pride myself on being efficient. When an application seems difficult to implement, often you just need to step back and look at different tools or technology to save yourself a lot of time and effort. I enjoy learning new tools and ways of thinking and do so very rapidly.
In my personal time, I find myself gravitating towards web app development and game design in my spare time. I participate in Global Game Jam, among other game jams, throughout the year. I also enjoy plenty of board games, Magic: The Gathering, No Man’s Sky, and playing with my cat, Beatrice.EDUCATION
